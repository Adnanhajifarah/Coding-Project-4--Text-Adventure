# Coding-Project-4--Text-Adventure
For lab assignment 5 you will be creating a text adventure game. Text
adventure games are games where the scene and adventure is written in
text and you give your user multiple decisions, leading them to different
fates.
You must first collect any relevant information about your user’s player:
● Name
● Age
● Height
● Health
● pet‘s name
● Type of pet
● Pet’s age
● Pet’s Health
At minimum your user (and pet) should have 10 different decisions to
make. (Asking users for the above input does not count towards the 10
decisions)
This program is to test your creativity. Create a story that your character
should go on and make their decisions have consequences.
Make sure your lab as at least one of the following:
1. If statements
2. Switch Cases
3. Mathematical operations (+,*,/,%,-)
4. Each of the data types (int, double, string, char, bool)
Example
Harry and his dog, Leo, see a feather, a hammer, and a
sword in front of them.
Which item should Harry grab?
1. Feather
2. Hammer
3. Sword
Harry grabbed the Feather.
Oh no! A dragon attacked Harry and Leo! Since Harry didn't
grab a sword the dragon swooped down and made Leo his
lunch!
